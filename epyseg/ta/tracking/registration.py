# seems perfect --> gives no swapping --> just errors due to dupes and in that case I should just take the most likely cell --> cell with closest area or closest shape based on its vertices --> I'm almost done!!!!

# I think this shit is now fully coded...


# https://github.com/voxelmorph/voxelmorph --> is that what I was looking for ???
# maybe what I was looking for https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WiqyF7dCdnNBIANEY80Pxw_mVz4fyV-S?usp=sharing --> bingo I found you THIS IS JUST EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED / NEEDED AND IT'S TENSORFLOW 2.0!!!!!!!!!!


# nb the IJ sift align works very well too but couldn't find an easy python equivalent...

# the idea is to crop further and further the image in order to get pyramidal correction of seefd position in order to get the correct tracking done

# get an image chop it into tiles then chop each registered tile further and register it on the big image or change the stuff


# or do smaller things
# or detect a swap and if a swap is detected then try recompute the translation

# or chop new image into small tiles and try to match each of these tiles on the bigger one

# try combinations of these things

# think about it


# try register a small region on the big --> how would that work if images don't have the same size

# ask for depth of tiling


# from skimage.feature import register_translation
from skimage.registration import phase_cross_correlation # change in scipy 0.19
# image = data.camera()
from skimage import transform

# really very good

# parameters

# threshold
# threshold_translation = 64  # all the further translations should be small --> if that is not the case then there has to be a pb
