12-16/11/2020
-Fixed a bug when 'rotate (interpolation free)' was used as an augmentation and image had different width and height
-Fixed float32 image preview when they had negative values...
-Fixed a bug when retraining the EPySeg model (bug was linked to the nb of channels of GT)
-Replaced from skimage.morphology import watershed with from skimage.segmentation import watershed (as it will be removed in future versions)
-Added support for setting learning rate to the EPySeg GUI
-Added reduce learning rate on plateau to the EPySeg GUI
-Re-trained model will be pushed later this week or the week after
-Fixed an issue with validation data (validation dataset was not properly created)
-Enabled interpolation free data augmentation by default (check box at the bottom of data augmentation)

10/11/2020
-Fixed a big bug forcing binarisation of model predictions (the bug affects custom/user loaded models, except if it has 7 classes)
-Added support for *.lsm files (may crash if lsm contain more than one time point, same is true for tifs btw --> need do some changes in the code at some point to support time)

10/09/2020
-Reduced number of pretrained models to one (that model is globally more sensitive/precise/versatile than the other)
-Changed the mask refinement algorithm for the pretrained model
-Removed the 'post process' tab (redundant with that in the 'predict' tab)
-Greatly improved/extended documentation
-Added help buttons throughout the GUI
-Cleaned the GUI

17/07/2020
-Tensorflow-gpu is not installed by default on Mac (i.e. fixed the setup.py file)

16/07/2020
-Fixed a bug that may have filled the google drive trash bin unnecessarily

15/07/2020
-Fixed a windows specific bug due to os.rename with existing file (changed to os.replace, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45636341/is-it-wise-to-remove-files-using-os-rename-instead-of-os-remove-in-python)

08/07/2020
-Made the code backwards compatible with tf 2.0.0 to allow support for anaconda (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/tensorflow)
-'Refine' is now enabled by default when using a pre-trained model because it should increase output quality in most cases

16/06/2020
-First public release
